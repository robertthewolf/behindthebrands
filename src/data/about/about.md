Marketa has built up her expertise through various positions in large international as well as local companies alongside her cooperation with individuals and variety of projects.

Her experience with Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Lasvit and special event management during Prague Fashion Week all gave her great insights into brands and made her knowledgeable in the field of luxury, beauty and lifestyle. Knowing the background of the top European brands (digital, retail and exclusive positioning) was clearly a competitive advantage when she started her own marketing and business development consultancy agency. After she moved to Beijing she established a strong network within local brands, Key Opinion Leaders and investment communities. That is why her agency creates value not only for domestic companies, but also for the European brands when they want to enter the largest market in the world.
