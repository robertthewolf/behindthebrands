My enthusiasm for developing and managing brand identity goes had in had with my working experience in marketing, luxury retail and e-tail business. I am thrilled by reaching to people through strategies and visions that transform the brand and uncover more of its potential.

I have been building my expertise while working in various positions in large international as well as local companies alongside the cooperation with individuals and variety of projects. My experience with Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Lasvit and special event management during Prague Fashion Week all gave me a great insights into brands and made me knowledgeable in the field of luxury, beauty and lifestyle. 

Knowing the background of the top European brands (both digital and retail) I have started my own marketing and business development consultancy agency while moving from Prague to Beijing. 

Since my relocation to China I have established a strong network within local brands, key opinion leaders and investment communities. That is why my agency creates value not only for domestic companies, but also for the European brands when they want to enter the largest market in the world.
