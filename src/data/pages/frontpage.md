"Mutual trust, common goals and shared values are the heart and soul of my work. I am a great believer in connections between people and the importance of emotions."

My enthusiasm for developing and managing brand identity goes hand in hand with my working experience in marketing, luxury retail and e-tail business. I am passionate about reaching to people through a strategy and a vision that transforms the brand and uncovers more of its potential.

I have been building my expertise working on a variety of projects at various positions in large international as well as local companies, and through cooperation with inspiring individuals. My working experience at Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Lasvit and the Prague Fashion Week gave me  great insights into brands and made me very familiar with the fields of luxury, beauty and lifestyle.

With a background know-how from top European brands (both digital and retail), I started my own marketing and business development consultancy after I moved from Prague to Beijing.

Since my relocation to China, I have built a strong network of local brands, key opinion leaders and investment communities. That is why the agency I established is able to create value, not only for domestic companies, but also for European brands intending to enter the largest market in the world.
