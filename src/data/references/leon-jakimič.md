Markéta has all the attributes of the great brand communicator. She has bright mind and conscientiously cultivated communication skills. When hired as a digital marketing pioneer at Lasvit she has successfully proved her ability to connect traditional marketing with the latest trends to present luxury products in the digital age. Now I am happy to collaborate with her again in China.
